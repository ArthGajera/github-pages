## Projects

### Survival Horror Game with AI-Driven Zombies

**Description:**  
Immersive survival horror game built in Unreal Engine (C++), featuring a dynamic dialogue system, attack mechanics, and AI-controlled zombies. Zombies use AI perception to detect and chase players, creating tense encounters. Players earn health boosts as rewards for defeating zombies.

- **Platform:** PC
- **Engine:** Unreal Engine
- **Demo:** <video src="./Zombie Ai.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls>)Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
- **Features:**  
  - AI perception for enemy detection and pursuit  
  - Dialogue and attack systems  
  - Reward/upgrade mechanics

### A Smart and Integrated Traffic Control System

**Description:**  
C++-based simulation platform for testing and visualizing traffic management strategies. Introduced a density-based scheduling algorithm that improved traffic flow by 42.9% over traditional methods. Used OpenGL for interactive visualization and implemented deadlock prevention with operating system principles.

- **Platform:** PC
- **Engine:** Custom (C++/OpenGL)
- **Features:**  
  - Density-based traffic scheduling  
  - Comparative analysis of scheduling algorithms (FIFO, SJF, custom)  
  - Deadlock prevention and visualization

### Adaptive Cyber Defense Framework
**Description:**  
A cybersecurity framework integrating Moving Target Defense (MTD), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and containerized honeypots. Utilizes IP randomization, dynamic honeypot deployment, and machine learning for adaptive threat response. Simulated and evaluated using Nmap and Wireshark.

- **Platform:** Linux/Cloud
- **Technologies:** Python, OpenFlow, Ryu, Mininet, ML frameworks
- **Features:**  
  - Dynamic network defense with SDN  
  - Machine learning-driven threat analysis  
  - Automated cyberattack simulations
